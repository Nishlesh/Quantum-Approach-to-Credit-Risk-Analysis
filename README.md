# Option Pricing with Quantum Methods

Welcome to the Option Pricing with Quantum Methods repository! This project is designed to introduce basic theory about option pricing for derivatives and explore the application of quantum computing methods to enhance financial computations.

## Overview

In this repository, we will cover:

1. **Basic Theory of Option Pricing for Derivatives**:
    - Introduction to options and derivatives
    - Fundamental concepts in option pricing
    - Black-Scholes model and its limitations
    - Other classical models in option pricing

2. **Quantum Methods in Finance**:
    - Introduction to quantum computing
    - Quantum algorithms relevant to finance
    - Applying quantum methods to option pricing

## Schedule

### Week 1: Introduction to Option Pricing
We will start with an in-depth exploration of the basic theory of option pricing for derivatives. This will include a detailed discussion on the Black-Scholes model and other classical approaches.
Read and try to Understand all material that has been shared with you from the course SI527. You don't need to understand proofs.

### Week 2: Quantum Approch For Derivative Pricing
In the subsequent weeks, we will delve into the use of quantum methods for option pricing. This will be based on the methodologies described in the provided Jupyter Notebook: **Quantum_Approach_for_Financial_Derivatives_Pricing.ipynb
**.

Contents for subsequent weeks will be shared later
